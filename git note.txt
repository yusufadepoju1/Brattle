If you want to remove both your email and username from Git, follow these steps:


---

1. Remove Global Git Email and Username

Check current settings:

git config --global --list

Remove email and username globally:

git config --global --unset user.email
git config --global --unset user.name

To verify changes:

git config --global --list


---

2. Remove Email and Username from a Specific Repository

If you set these details for a specific repository, navigate to the repository folder:

cd /path/to/repository

Run the following commands to remove them:

git config --unset user.email
git config --unset user.name

To confirm:

git config --list


---

3. Remove Email from GitHub (if applicable)

If your email is linked to GitHub:

1. Go to GitHub ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Emails.


2. Remove or update the email.




---

4. Clear Cached Credentials (Optional)

If you've saved credentials and want to clear them:

git credential reject https://github.com

For Windows, clear stored credentials:

1. Open Credential Manager.


2. Go to Windows Credentials.


3. Find git: https://github.com and remove it.

Why Create a Branch in Git?

Branches in Git allow developers to work on new features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main (production) code. This keeps the project stable while enabling collaboration and parallel development.


---

How to Create and Use a Git Branch

1. Check Existing Branches

Before creating a new branch, check the current branches:

git branch

2. Create a New Branch

git branch feature-branch-name

Example:

git branch new-feature

3. Switch to the New Branch

git checkout feature-branch-name

Or, using the newer syntax:

git switch feature-branch-name

Example:

git switch new-feature

4. Make Changes and Commit

Modify files, then add and commit changes:

git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"

5. Push the Branch to GitHub (If Needed)

git push origin feature-branch-name

6. Merge the Branch into Main

Once the work is complete, merge the changes back to the main branch:

git checkout main
git merge feature-branch-name

7. Delete the Branch (If No Longer Needed)

git branch -d feature-branch-name


---

Benefits of Using Branches

‚úÖ Isolated Development ‚Äì Work on features separately without breaking the main code.
‚úÖ Collaboration ‚Äì Multiple developers can work on different features at the same time.
‚úÖ Version Control ‚Äì Each branch maintains its own history.
‚úÖ Safe Experimentation ‚Äì Try new features without affecting the main project.

Viewing the History of Your Commits in Git

Git provides several ways to check the history of commits, helping you track changes and understand project progress.


---

1. View Basic Commit History

git log

This shows a list of commits with details like commit hash, author, date, and message.


---

2. View a Condensed History (One Line Per Commit)

git log --oneline

This shows each commit‚Äôs short hash and message in a single line.


---

3. View a Graph of Branches and Merges

git log --oneline --graph --all --decorate

This visually represents commit history and branching.


---

4. View History of a Specific File

git log -- filename

Example:

git log -- README.md

This shows only commits that modified the specified file.


---

5. View Changes in Each Commit

git log -p

This includes the differences (diffs) introduced in each commit.


---

6. View Commits by a Specific Author

git log --author="Your Name"


---

7. View Commits Within a Time Range

git log --since="1 week ago"

Or

git log --after="2024-01-01" --before="2024-03-01"


---

8. Check a Specific Number of Commits

git log -n 5

This shows only the last 5 commits.


---

9. Check the Commit History of a Branch

git log main

Replace main with any branch name.


---

10. View History Using Git GUI Tools

If you prefer a graphical interface:

GitHub Desktop (for GitHub users)

GitKraken (cross-platform GUI for Git)

SourceTree (great for Git workflows)



---

Which One Should You Use?

Use git log --oneline for a quick summary.

Use git log --graph for visualizing branches.

Use git log -p to see changes in each commit.

### **How to Revert a Commit in Git**  

Reverting a commit means undoing its changes while preserving the history. There are different methods based on whether the commit has been pushed or not.  

---

### **1. Revert a Commit (Creates a New Undo Commit) [Safe Method]**  
If you want to undo a commit but keep track of the change in the history:  
```sh
git revert <commit-hash>
```  
Example:  
```sh
git revert abc1234
```  
- This creates a new commit that undoes the changes from `abc1234`.  
- If there are conflicts, resolve them before committing.  

For pushed commits:  
```sh
git push origin main
```  

---

### **2. Undo the Last Commit (Before Pushing) [Soft Reset]**  
If you haven't pushed the commit yet and want to **remove it but keep the changes**:  
```sh
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```  
- The commit is removed, but changes remain **staged**.  

If you want to **unstage** the changes as well:  
```sh
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
```  

If you want to **discard changes completely**:  
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This deletes changes permanently.  

---

### **3. Undo a Commit That Was Already Pushed (With Caution)**
If you've already pushed the commit and want to **remove it**, use:  
```sh
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git push --force
```  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This rewrites history and can cause issues for collaborators.  

If working in a team, **use `git revert` instead** to avoid conflicts.

---

### **Which One Should You Use?**
- ‚úÖ **`git revert`** ‚Äì Safe for collaboration (creates a new commit that undoes changes).  
- ‚úÖ **`git reset --soft`** ‚Äì Removes the commit but keeps your changes.  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **`git reset --hard`** ‚Äì Deletes the commit **and** changes (use with caution).

### **Fork & Pull: A Collaborative Model in GitHub**  

The **Fork & Pull model** is a widely used collaboration workflow, especially for open-source projects. It allows developers to contribute without needing direct write access to the main repository.  

---

## **üîπ How Fork & Pull Works**  
1. **Fork the Repository** ‚Üí Create your own copy of the project.  
2. **Clone Your Fork Locally** ‚Üí Work on your own machine.  
3. **Create a New Branch** ‚Üí Keep changes organized.  
4. **Make Changes & Commit** ‚Üí Add your new feature or fix bugs.  
5. **Push to Your Forked Repo** ‚Üí Upload your changes to GitHub.  
6. **Create a Pull Request (PR)** ‚Üí Request to merge your changes into the original repo.  
7. **Review & Merge** ‚Üí The project maintainer reviews and merges your PR.  

---

## **üîπ Step-by-Step Guide to Fork & Pull**  

### **Step 1: Fork the Repository**  
- Go to the original GitHub repository.  
- Click **Fork** (top-right corner).  
- This creates a copy under your GitHub account.  

### **Step 2: Clone Your Fork Locally**  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
```  
Navigate into the project folder:  
```sh
cd repository-name
```  

### **Step 3: Add the Original Repository as an Upstream Remote**  
To keep your fork updated with the original project:  
```sh
git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repository-name.git
```  
Verify remotes:  
```sh
git remote -v
```  

### **Step 4: Create a New Branch for Your Changes**  
```sh
git checkout -b feature-branch
```  

### **Step 5: Make Changes & Commit**  
Edit files, then stage and commit changes:  
```sh
git add .
git commit -m "Added new feature"
```  

### **Step 6: Push Changes to Your Fork**  
```sh
git push origin feature-branch
```  

### **Step 7: Create a Pull Request (PR)**  
- Go to **your forked repository** on GitHub.  
- Click **"Compare & pull request"**.  
- Write a brief description and submit the PR.  

### **Step 8: Maintain Sync with the Original Repo (Optional)**  
To pull new changes from the original repo:  
```sh
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main
git push origin main
```  

---

## **üîπ Why Use Fork & Pull?**  
‚úÖ Ideal for **open-source contributions**.  
‚úÖ Ensures maintainers **control the main repo**.  
‚úÖ Prevents unauthorized changes to the project.  
‚úÖ Encourages **collaborative development**.
